              <h2>The Benefits of Self-Compassion</h2>
              <p>Being kind to yourself may not come easy — but research shows that practicing self-compassion has many benefits for your mental health.</p>
            </div>
            <p>If you tend to judge yourself harshly, criticize your thoughts and actions, or blame yourself for small mistakes, know that you’re not alone. Harmful self-talk is second nature for many people and it can have a major toll on your self-worth.</p>
            <p>“It can be difficult to have self-compassion — even when you’re compassionate to others — because we tend to have a higher expectation of ourselves,” says Elizabeth Fedrick, PhD, LPC, a licensed psychotherapist based in Gilbert and Phoenix, Arizona.</p>
            <p>Research by Kristin Neff, PhD — a leading expert in self-compassion — has shown that people who practice being kinder to themselves are less likely to be anxious, stressed, and depressed. They’re also more likely to be happy and optimistic about the future.</p>

              <h2>Why the Little Things in a Relationship Mean Everything</h2>
              <p>Grand gestures of love can bring surprise and joy to your partner, but the little things in relationships may consistently strengthen your bond and increase emotional security.</p>
            </div>
            <p>Would you prefer having your partner gift you a new car or show you one small act of affection and thoughtfulness daily?
              For many people, daily affirmations and acts of love and caring mean more than a singular, grand gesture.
              The little things in relationships can be constant reminders that your partner thinks of you and cares about you.
              Small acts count because they can help:
              reduce uncertainty
              provide a sense of emotional security
              solidify the bond between two people
              increase empathy
              reduce the chance of growing apart</p>
            <p>In subtle ways, the little things, more than the grand gestures, can strengthen your relationship and make love last.</p>

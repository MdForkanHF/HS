              <h2>Setting Boundaries with Your Parents</h2>
              <p>Your parents may toil with releasing control over their adult child. You may have a hard time separating yourself. Boundaries can empower you and improve the fitness of your bond.</p>
            </div>
            <p>As an adult, boundaries with parents are like vehicle tires: Nearly everyone has them, but you don’t know what shape they’re in until the rubber hits the road.</p>
            <p>Perhaps you have a good relationship but are enmeshed in each other’s lives. Some parents may have been overprotective when you were growing up, usually coming from a place of love. Nevertheless, they’re having a hard time letting go.</p>
            <p>Still, other parents may be toxic, manipulative, or abusive and you’re needing to take a stand.</p>
            <p>Whether you have porous or rigid boundaries, the lack of healthy boundaries can actually create tension and resentment, hindering a sound relationship with your parent.</p>
